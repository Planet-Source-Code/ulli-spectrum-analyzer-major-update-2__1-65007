Spectrum Analyzer

Gets sound input from the current recording source and displays it as spectrum and as waterfall. The peaks on the left are mains hum (which is 50 cps in Europe) and it's harmonics plus the noise of some cars passing by outside. You can even see a tiny trace of the noise from the PC-fan at about 680 cps.
